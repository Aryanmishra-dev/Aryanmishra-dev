## About Me
<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="220" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/229223263-cf2e4b07-2615-4f87-9c38-e37600f8381a.gif">


I believe that the best technology is the one that solves real problems elegantly. This philosophy drives my work in machine learning, where I focus on not just building models but creating complete systems that are scalable, maintainable, and actually useful in production environments.

My journey in AI started with curiosity about how machines can learn and make decisions. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a deep passion for understanding the intricacies of machine learning algorithms and deploying them effectively. I enjoy the entire lifecycle of ML projects—from initial experimentation and research to final deployment and monitoring.

## What I Do

<br/>

**Large Language Models:** I build RAG pipelines, AI agents, and conversational AI systems. I'm fascinated by how LLMs can be fine-tuned and optimized for specific use cases.

**Deep Learning:** I work extensively with PyTorch and TensorFlow for NLP and Computer Vision applications.

**Full-Stack AI Applications:** I create end-to-end solutions from data ingestion to user-facing interfaces.

**MLOps and Infrastructure:** I focus on building robust ML pipelines and containerizing applications with Docker.

## My Approach

I strongly believe in writing clean, readable code and documenting my work thoroughly. I enjoy breaking down complex AI systems into simple, understandable components. This not only helps others understand my work but also helps me think more clearly about the problems I'm solving.
